Planning for Zowe Face to Face for Aug 4, 2019 (Sunday before SHARE)

Remove Eureka Service agenda
#112 opened 2 days ago by nkocsis 
Remove Eureka UI - Graphical interface, similar to Catalog which displays the data running through EUREKA server
 Solution: Remove the ability to access EUREKA UI. Customers can still hook up their services with EUREKA Server, but they wouldn't have a graphical interface to troubleshoot and see all REST API's in one place. They would have to work with EUREKA messaging only.
